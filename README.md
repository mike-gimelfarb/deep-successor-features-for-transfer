# successor-features-for-transfer
A reusable framework and independent implementation for successor features (SF) for transfer in (deep) reinforcement learning using keras, based on [1].

Currently supports:
- tabular SF representations for discrete environments, based on an efficient hash table representation
- deep neural network SF representations for large or continuous-state environments, based on keras; allows existing keras models or custom architectures (e.g. CNNs) as inputs for easy training and tuning
- tasks with pre-defined state features only, although support for training features on-the-fly may be added later
- tasks structured according to the OpenAI gym framework

# Requirements
- python 3.8 or later
- tensorflow 2.3 or later
- pygame 2.0.1. or later (for some environments)
